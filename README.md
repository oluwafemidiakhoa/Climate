# Climate Project üåç

This project leverages machine learning models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to analyze and simulate climate trends based on historical temperature data.

## Project Overview

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. This project uses machine learning to:
- Analyze historical temperature trends from the **GlobalLandTemperatures dataset**.
- Generate potential future climate scenarios.
- Explore clustering of countries based on temperature patterns.

### Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes global and country-specific temperature trends.
   - Highlights regions with significant warming patterns.

2. **Generative Models**:
   - **VAE**: Simulates temperature anomalies under various conditions.
   - **GAN**: Creates realistic, synthetic temperature scenarios.

3. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - Interactive tools for exploring generated future climate trends.
